## What and why
This app generates semi-randomized naughty stories based on React.js, JSON-files as a pseudo-database and Spintax. It replaces names, gender pronouns and randomly selects from lists of possible actions to generate surprisingly readable sex stories. 

The why is just as short as the what: It seemed like a fun way to learn a bit about React, HTMl and CSS and of course for the giggles. It was a fun project that taught me a lot. Find it deployed at https://competent-yalow-36197e.netlify.com/
